# You can mine for gold, or you can sell pickaxes

A common counterpoint to all this is: why do you think a company like @cloudflare would build tooling for NFT if it wasn't a real thing? It's not like I consider them a bad/failed company, and they wouldn't build something that would lose them money. 

But there is a perfect rational reason to do that, which those in tech have heard often. “You can mine for gold, or you can sell pickaxes”. Cloudflare is selling you the pickaxe.

很多公司再做NFT，不意味着他们自己坚信NFT能成功，只能说明卖工具能赚钱。
