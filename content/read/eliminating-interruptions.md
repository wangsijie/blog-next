# 排除干扰保持专注可以提升开发效率

很多人觉得白天在办公室效率很低，自己回家熬夜的效率要高很多。这可能是因为，办公室里的干扰太多了。如果能找到方法在正常的工作时间内不受干扰、保持专注，那么也可以达到早起或者熬夜的那个“专注”效果。

提到早起的好处，最重要的一点就是可以专心工作。但是早起很难做到，不如试一下减少工作时的干扰吧。

Sirens flare in my head whenever I hear a developer say "I can't get anything done around here during normal working hours." A long story about how he comes in early or stays late - or both - inevitably follows.

If you can't get your job done inside normal working hours, you're being interrupted too often. Change your environment, not your working hours. Crazy time-shifting destroys important non-work relationships and crashes your personal life. Will your tombstone read "brought the XYZ project in on time", or "gave of himself always, loved by everyone"?

A central tenant of eXtreme Programming is we never work two 40 hour workweeks in a row. There's a lot to love and hate about XP, but this rule expresses obvious truisms about people: we need outside lives. We get tired and run down. Rested people are productive people. But to keep to a 40 hour workweek we have to get interruptions under control.

It takes 15 minutes, on average, for your brain to move from active perception of the busy-ness around you to being totally and productively engaged in the cyberworld of coding. Yet a mere 11 minutes passes between interruptions for the average developer. Ever wonder why firmware costs so much? Email, the phone, people looking for coffee filters and your boss all clamor for attention. If you do not manage these interruptions you cannot be productive.

DeMarco and Lister claim a 300% difference in productivity between software teams interrupted often and those who aren't. 300%! Clearly we have to manage our interruptions; the alternative is missed schedules.

Most companies sentence developers to cubicles rather than private offices. Dilbert aptly names these antiproductivity pods. Cubes are concentration vampires. Who can think when you can't block out the sound of your neighbor's call to his divorce lawyer?

Figure out when your brain is most effective; for me it's first thing in the morning. Take control of these hours. Turn off the email, cut the phone cord, blanket the PA system with headphones, and pull a curtain across the opening that masquerades  as a door. Schedule meetings for some other time. Guard these precious hours and use them to focus on your project. It's astonishing how much work you'll accomplish.

My Rule of Thumb: Developers who live in cubicles probably aren't very productive. Check how they manage interruptions.
